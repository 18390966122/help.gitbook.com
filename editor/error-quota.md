When using the online Editor, you may encounter an error "Quota has been exceeded" if your book is hosted on GitHub. This is a limitation from GitHub, that prevents too much operations to happen on the network.

We are working on removing this limitation. But for now, your only solution is to edit your book offline (using the Desktop Editor for example), or to wait before editing your book online again.
