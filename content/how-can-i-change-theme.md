Since GitBook's v3 release, the entire theme can be changed and customized. Installing a theme is just like [installing a plugin](how-can-i-add-plugin.md).

Themes work by extending the HTML templates and CSS of the default book. If you are interested in tweaking a theme, or making your own, more infos is available [in the documentation](http://toolchain.gitbook.com/themes/).
