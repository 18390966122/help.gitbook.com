You can [delete your GitBook user account](https://www.gitbook.com/settings/delete) at any time. Before you do so, you must hand over the reins of any organizations you might own and delete or transfer ownership of all your existing books.

This action **CANNOT** be undone. Discussions you've created and comments you've made in books owned by other users will not be deleted - instead, they'll be associated with a Ghost user.

The account name also becomes available to anyone else to use on a new account, and we stop billing you.
