The main way to collaborate on someone's book is to **become a [collaborator](/books/what-is-a-collaborator.md)** of the book, or a **member of the book's organization**. But sometimes you would simply want to submit a small contribution, without becoming a regular collaborator.

On GitHub, one can use the popular _Pull Request_ feature to do that. To do so, you would clone the original work, make changes on your own copy, and submit back your changes by submitting a _Pull Request_ to the original author. Then the author is free to integrate your changes.

There is no such feature on GitBook.com yet. For now however, you can still **[link your book to GitHub](/github/can-i-host-on-github.md)** and host it there. After that, people will be able to open _Pull Requests_ your GitHub repository.
